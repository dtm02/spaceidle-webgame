This is my first full-stack app! My goal with this is to get a familiary with Node. I'm using TypeScript because I find it easier to implement unfamiliar technology thanks to the intellisense.
It's an idle game where you control a fleet of starships, officers aboard them, and their exploration!
I'm watching lots of Star Trek right now, so it's kinda inspired by that, but with my own set of ships and characters.
Main thingies that I want to learn with this app:
Log in & Secure Auth cookies
Sending from Client -> Server DB
Loading from Server DB -> Client
Pretty CSS Animations
Dynamic pages using EJS
