# Space Idle Web Game (Title TBD)

## Overview
An idle web game where you control a fleet of starships, officers aboard them, and their exploration!
I'm watching lots of Star Trek right now, so it's kinda inspired by that, but with my own set of ships and characters.

This is my first full-stack app! My goal with this is to get a familiary with Node.js and complementary technology. 
I chose TypeScript, rather than JS because I find it easier to implement unfamiliar technology thanks to the intellisense.

### Project Objectives
* Stream real-time actions from Client -> Server, with sanity checks
* Implement client log in & secure authentication cookies
* Server-side Persistent Database 
* Data retrieval from Server -> Client
* Dynamic pages using [EJS](https://ejs.co/)
* Pretty CSS Animations
